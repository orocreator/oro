WEEKLY EXECUTION STATUS
--------------------------------------------------

Week 0 – Planning & Preparation
Status: COMPLETED

Completed:
- Interviewed product requirements via Claude (detailed Q&A)
- Aligned on MVP thesis (Decision Engine first)
- Defined core architecture (Control Plane / Execution Plane)
- Explicitly deferred non-MVP features to prevent scope creep
- Drafted implementation-agnostic PRD.md
- Drafted detailed implementation plan with tech stack and timeline
- Established progress tracking system
- PRD approved and locked
- Implementation plan approved and locked

--------------------------------------------------

Week 1 – Foundation
Status: IN PROGRESS

Completed:
- (none yet)

In progress:
- Initialize repo structure
- Set up Supabase project + initial schema
- Configure Clerk authentication
- Deploy first empty shell to Vercel

Blocked / Open questions:
- Instagram API scope (will determine during integration)
- TikTok API access status (will attempt, fallback to manual if unavailable)

--------------------------------------------------
CURRENT FOCUS (NEXT 48–72 HOURS)
--------------------------------------------------

1. Initialize repo structure (monorepo with Next.js + Python workers)
2. Set up Supabase project + initial schema
3. Configure Clerk authentication
4. Basic layout: sidebar, main content area
5. Deploy first empty shell to Vercel

--------------------------------------------------
MVP SCOPE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------

In scope:
- Auth (email/OAuth, single user)
- Platform connections (Instagram deep, YouTube/TikTok shallow)
- Content sync from connected platforms
- Manual ingestion (upload, URL import)
- Creator DNA (onboarding, profile, goals)
- Trend intelligence (Meta Ad Library, pattern detection)
- Decision engine (single recommendation with reasoning)
- Execution (script, caption, hashtag generation)
- AI Toolkit (basic text + image gen)
- Analytics (simple performance dashboard)
- Credits (consumption tracking)

--------------------------------------------------
OUT OF SCOPE (INTENTIONALLY)
--------------------------------------------------

The following are explicitly deferred and should not be worked on unless PRD is amended:

- Node-based editing
- Video generation
- Voice generation
- Negative prompts, reference images
- Template style presets (Cinematic, Professional, etc.)
- Multiple outputs at once
- Automated Creator DNA updates
- Recommendation quality scoring
- A/B experiment infrastructure
- Auto-publishing / scheduled publishing
- Cross-platform comparison charts
- Retention curve analysis
- Competitive benchmarking
- Multi-user permissions / teams
- Role-based access
- Workspace switching
- Stripe integration
- Subscription tiers
- Feature gating by tier
- Credit purchases

--------------------------------------------------
TECH STACK (IMPLEMENTATION PLAN)
--------------------------------------------------

Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
API: tRPC (Next.js API routes)
Auth: Clerk
Database: Supabase (Postgres)
Queue: Inngest
Workers: Python (Railway)
Object Storage: Cloudflare R2
LLM Routing: Custom (start simple, extend later)

--------------------------------------------------
NOTES / DECISIONS
--------------------------------------------------

- Quality > perceived speed
- Async is acceptable, silent waiting is not
- LLMs handle intelligence, not raw media processing
- Cost-efficient models (Kimi K2.5, etc.) preferred for analysis
- Claude/GPT reserved for creative outputs
- Market-driven intelligence first, user-personalized second
- Multi-tenant data model from day one (even if UI is single-user)
- Official APIs preferred; unofficial methods are optional enrichment only

--------------------------------------------------
SECURITY CHECKLIST
--------------------------------------------------

Dependency Management:
- [ ] Dependency approval gate: All installs require explicit human approval
- [ ] No curl|bash or wget|bash — never pipe remote scripts to shell
- [ ] Pin versions: Use exact versions in package.json, not ranges
- [ ] Audit cadence: Run `pnpm audit` weekly (minimum)
- [ ] Review postinstall scripts before allowing new dependencies

Secrets:
- [ ] Never commit .env files (gitignored)
- [ ] Use .env.example for templates (no real values)
- [ ] No credentials in code or comments
